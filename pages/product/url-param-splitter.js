        <p>
          I created a URL Parameter Splitter Chrome extension using Google Gemini and some personal knowledge of HTML. The URL Parameter Splitter is designed to split URL parameters (the stuff after the ? in the URL) and put it in a easy-to-read manner.

          <h3>The Problem</h3>
          <p>
            While I was working on email marketing campaigns, my manager taught me about URL parameters and how we used to them to track which email brought a customer to our website. He had an app where you could paste a URL into a text editor, press a few buttons, and then all the URL parameters would be split out. Unfortunately the name of that app and the code were lost when we both lost our jobs.</p>
          <p>
            URL parameters can tell you a lot about advertising, and I was also working at a place that utilized URL parameters to track which ad brought a customer to our website. I was looking for a way to easily see the URL parameters broken out without going to another tab and using an external website or having to paste the URL into a text editor. Thus, the URL Parameter Splitter was born.

          <h3>Prototyping</h3>
          <p>
            TBD. I went and looked for examples but I knew I just wanted to make a table-like format.

          <h3>Development</h3>
          <p>
            I saw that a lot of people were making new apps and extensions by only utilizing AI, so I decided to also use AI. (Besides, I didn't know where to even start when it came to making my own extension.) I used Google Gemini and after much trial and error, I was able to get the right Javascript code to be able to get the extension to work. I also used some personal knowledge of HTML to make some tweaks to the formatting.

          <h3>The Result</h3>
          <p>
            I was able to make a private Chrome Extension that when pressed, will show you the URL of the website you're on and the URL parameters broken out. The code can be found on my GitHub.
